\chapter*{Introduction}

This document contains my notes for my Spring Term Physics IP (Independent Project) entitled \textit{Advanced Electrodynamics}, taken during my last term at Phillips Academy Andover. Jeffrey Shi was my partner for the group IP and our mentor was Ms.~Fei Yao. Our main reference text is \textit{Introduction to Electrodynamics}, 4th edition by Griffiths.

% I have also included some of our solutions to selected problems from the text. The numbering of these problems follows the book, rather than this document. We tried to tackle every problem marked with a bullet $\bullet$ or an exclamation point \textbf{!}. We also tackled any other problems that we found interesting.
