# William Yue's Academic Notes

This github repository contains `.tex` and `.pdf` files for notes on subjects I'm studying.
Hopefully you find them interesting. 

I do inevitably do a lot of "copying from the textbook,"
but I will try to add my own input and explanations in places, and will try to go through my
thought process whenever I make significant breakthroughs ("aha!" moments). 

## Subjects

Right now, I have

<ul>
    <li><strong>Representation Theory</strong>, using <a href="https://klein.mit.edu/~etingof/repb.pdf">Etingof's Book</a></li>
    <!-- <li></li> -->
</ul>
